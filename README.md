## About The Project

Describe the purpose and goals of your CNN project. Explain what problem it solves or what task it accomplishes. Provide a brief overview of the project's features and functionalities.

## Built With

Python: Programming language used for developing the application.
Keras: Deep learning library utilized for building and training the CNN model.
TensorFlow: Backend framework used by Keras for efficient computation on GPUs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the CNN Image Classification Application, the following prerequisites are required:

Python 3: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Install the following libraries
pip install opencv-python
pip install tensorflow
pip install mlxtend  

### Installation

To set up the environment and install the dependencies, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/gmtuquerrez/ManejoDatos.git
Change to the project directory: cd your_project
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Additional steps or instructions for any specific configuration or setup.

## Usage

-Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset by organizing it into appropriate training, validation, and testing sets. Ensure the images are labeled and structured correctly.
-Training: Run the training script to train the CNN model on your dataset. Adjust the hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size, according to your specific requirements.
-Evaluation: After training, evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Compute metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's effectiveness.
-Prediction: Utilize the trained CNN model to make predictions on new images. Provide the path to the input image(s) and obtain the predicted class labels as the output.
